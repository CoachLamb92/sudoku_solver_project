A solo project where I aim to create a sudoku-solving file

# To-do list:
## Pressing:
- Create Area class
- Test Area class
- Confine Area class to be square-shaped (only when passed square-numbered grid sizes)

## General:
- Add documentation
- Requirements file
- Test many methods and attributes on pre-made 4x4 grid
- Develop algorithms to eliminate potentials

## Stretch:


## Completed:
